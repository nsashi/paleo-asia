Repository for reproducing the paper **"Coherent streamflow variability in Monsoon Asia over the past eight centuries---links to oceanic drivers"** (Nguyen *et al*, submitted).

The file `vignette.Rmd` contains all analysis code along with explanations and visualizations. It will guide you through all the steps that I took to create the paper's results. It also contains some further results and illustrations that are not in the paper. For example, I provide all the 30 ensemble members for all stations (in the paper I reported only the best member).

If you have any questions or feedback, please drop me an email, or even better, raise a GitHub issue.
