Repository for reproducing the paper **"Coherent streamflow variability in Monsoon Asia over the past eight centuries---links to oceanic drivers"** (Nguyen *et al*, submitted).

To run, first download the whole repo in your desktop, unzip to a folder, and switch your working directory to it.

The file `paleo_asia.Rmd` contains all analysis code along with explanations and visualizations. It will guide you through all the steps that I took to create the paper's results. It also contains some further results and illustrations that are not in the paper. For example, I provide all the 30 ensemble members for all stations (in the paper I reported only the best member). You can run the code chunks as you go along to see intermediate results.

If you only need to see the code and results without running, open the file `paleo_asia.html` and view through.

The final reconstruction results are provided in `R/reconstructions_final.csv` and `R/skill_scores_final.csv`. You can download them if you want to use the reconstruction results for other work.

Please send me an email for questions and feedback. Even better, raise a GitHub issue.
